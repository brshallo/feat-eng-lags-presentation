# feat-eng-lags-presentation
Materials for 2021 presentations on "Feature Engineering with Sliding Windows and Lagged Inputs." 

* Presented to Research Triangle Analysts Meetup 
* as well as [updated slides](https://github.com/brshallo/feat-eng-lags-presentation/blob/main/presentations/rstats-wsu.pdf) for presentation to WSU R user group and [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=829&v=-wUzdeThODo&feature=youtu.be).

Presentations are adapted from my [blog post](https://www.bryanshalloway.com/2020/10/12/window-functions-for-resampling/) of the same name. Code for examples can be found there or in this [.R file](https://github.com/brshallo/feat-eng-lags-presentation/blob/main/R/feat-engineering-lags.R). (There are a few minor differences from code shown in the presentation -- primarily for demonstration or simplicity reasons.)
